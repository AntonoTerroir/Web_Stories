      cleaned the last of its porcelain statuettes. The night is so clear you chose
      to go out without a torch and enjoy the soft crispness of its light. You get
      up. As you proceed to dust your apron, you find yourself subjugated by an otherworldly
      sight. A pair of white monkeys is carrying what looks like a long vessel made
      of cloth. They enter the dark woods without a sound."

      the forest grows darker, the clarity of their coat changes into a downy gleam.
      For how long have you been observing them, perfectly captivated and incapable
      of thinking? When you finally look up, a myriad of creatures forms a solemn
      procession around you, following this never-ending path as far as your eyes
      can see. You no longer recognize these woods."

      but you soon find yourself surrounded by four pearly hounds. They walk slowly
      by your sides and you can't outrun them. Your feet leave the ground. Still
      rotating, your legs have become an absurd windmill as the dogs of nacre are
      already carrying you away from the field and from the earth. The world shrinks.
      The sky bloats. It\u2019s everywhere. You're floating across the cosmos."

      between the phosphorescent visions it's comprised of. Their silhouettes are
      stretching up in disarray as they multiply. They are spineless and overwhelming.
      Their uneven rhythm distorts the monotonous and exhilarating scrolling of the
      limp trees behind them. You're about to falter. You can't see anymore when
      your breath ends and suddenly, you plunge. The procession carries you right
      through the earth in a suspended vertigo."

      panic, strive and ramp up, losing your breath. Your consciousness weakens;
      in a trance, you abandon yourself to the glowing waves. Gently, they carry

      nullified the very idea of spatial orientation."

      of the parade into a voluptuous mass which envelops you entirely. Then, in
      a continuous movement, this impulse is reversed; the vast veil is torn to a
      million living pieces which bloom, shrink and disappear. A stellar disc appeared
      in front of you, inflating ominously. Penetrating it, you leave the underground
      and find yourself facing the altar once more, standing on the dirt path. There
      is no moon."

      now dancing around you. Slowly, these scraps change into a multitude of colorful
      larvae overloading your sight. The animated pattern of these pulsating dots
      seems to compose a teeming fresco. This vision is getting sharper and sharper
      now. You can see the altar inside it; you can see the path and very soon, you
      are there. The ground is beneath you."

      textures and unreal shapes. They scatter. The image of the concrete world seems
      to disaggregate entirely. Soon, its components are but a handful of dust vanishing

      still. A statuette is missing."

      Its pace doubles every six centuries; then it's exponential. When you notice
      it, angst takes hold of you. It too increases consistently. You fail to gather
      your senses and inertia sweeps you away. You're now swirling at an infernal,
      ever increasing speed and your chaos cartilage body is being torn apart when
      everything stops at once. You're on the path \u2013facing the altar. Standing

      the airs. A dense, thinly shimmering cloud appears on your way and you slide
      inside it delightfully. Its matter is so thick and grainy that your limbs cannot
      move. You're sinking deeper and deeper into these shifting sands, abandoning
      your strengths with exquisite peace. Their beige foam is the only thing you
      can distinguish now. You hear its continuous, seamless rustle."

      cloud's pinnacle, the sky appears. It is blank. You are aghast. Precipitated

      Its whole movement\u2014the dance of this universe\u2014is pure inertia. It

      The absolute inanity of the universe reveals itself in silence. Its void bloats
      limitlessly, dissolving the illusion of its existence. Void and death; from
      the onset and forever. But an absurd radiance quietly appears, drawing within
      the darkness the weakly illuminated outline of the altar and its dirt path.
      Its tree. Its forest. Its hollow field and then, beneath the field, the village.
      Where are you?"

      takes hold of you. This matter keeps thickening. Space shrinks. Lights multiply,
      coming closer each second. In complete silence, a ballet of microscopic stars
      assembles into ever-narrowing swirls. Their lace tightens. Soon, you can only
      distinguish a single, perfectly continuous surface. As its radiance gets stronger
      in some areas, it evokes an infinite landscape. A field expands into the distance.
      A forest trembles. A path soars and the heavy concretion of an altar binds
      it to the earth. You're on the ground.
